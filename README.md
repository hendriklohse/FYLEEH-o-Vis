We are all students studying at the TU/e (Technische Universiteit Eindhoven). This tool is made for a project from the course DBL HTI + Webtech (coursecode:  2IOA0 ). Our group number is 35E.

## Description

A visualization tool which can be used for data analysis on eye tracking data. Contains four types of visualisations, namely a heatmap, streamgraph, 3D line plot and a bar chart.

## How to start the tool

FYLEEH-o-Vis is a WordPress theme. This means it can be installed in any WordPress website using PHP (7.0.0 or higher) and MySQL MariaDB (10.0.0 or higher). To learn how to install WordPress, you can visit the page: wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/. You can either choose to install WordPress locally using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or you can find a host and domain to install [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). For TU/e data, pick the global-data in the data input when logged-out.

## Features
The heatmap provides analysis on fixation points. The streamgraph can be used to inspect the number of fixation points in certain, self-selected, areas of interest. Patterns can be studied using the 3D line plot. And lastly, the bar chart provides statistics, such as minimum, maximum and average time, of the currently selected data. A sample dataset has already been uploaded to the site which may be used to study how the visualisations work. Own data (in the same format) can be uploaded to the site as well.
